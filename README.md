# Laser-Cut Blueprint Generator

A Java application designed to use an Epson (or equilavent) wood-cutting laser to generate blueprints for custom-sized boxes.

## About

This project provides a simple way to define the parameters of a box, such as the dimensions and custom engravings. The goal is to generate an SVG file that can be sent directly to a laser cutter to "print" the necessary pieces for assembly.

Created by:
* Dennis Dutine
* Tate Eller 
* Cooper Stannard

## Features
* **Customizable Dimensions:** Specify the exact width, height, and depth of the box.
* **Text Engraving** Add initials to a specific number of sides the box.
