# Laser-Cut Blueprint Generator

A Java application designed to use an Epson (or equilavent) wood-cutting laser to generate blueprints for custom-sized boxes.

## About

This project provides a simple way to define the parameters of a box, such as the dimensions and custom engravings. The goal is to generate an SVG file that can be sent directly to a laser cutter to "print" the necessary pieces for assembly.
